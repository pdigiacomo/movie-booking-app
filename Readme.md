## Intro

### About the project
The Movie Booking project implements the tasks from the attached code test [case.pdf](case.pdf).

## Project type and architecture
This is a Maven-managed project with Spring Boot 3 and OpenAPI v3 (fka Swagger).

### How to run the application
The application has been written from the ground up with an API-first approach. All the API objects are generated by the [OpenAPI Generator Maven PLugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-maven-plugin) to automatically generate api and model, according to the attached design requirements in [REST API.pdf](REST%20API.pdf). Therefore, it is first of all necessary to generate the code by running `mvn clean compile`. The Maven build lifecycle manages the included integration tests. Running `mvn clean install` will both generate the API objects, compile the code, run the Spring Boot application and execute the tests.

### Database structure
The database structure is outlined in the following UML diagram:
